# Canonical projects of web faculty

Projects are created on the basis of platform materials without taking into account the material given by tutors.

*The chosen approaches may not seem optimal. However, they correspond to the solution of the current tasks.
Some code snippets contain comments on improvements and optimization as well as alternative solutions.*

Necessary materials:
- [Checklist for students](https://code.s3.yandex.net/web-developer/checklists-pdf/About_Me_Checklist.pdf)
- [Checklist for reviewers](https://www.notion.so/praktikum/Checklist-About-me-project-4347f69278e84cab977ff218aa8c8e3e)
- [Brief](https://code.s3.yandex.net/web-developer/project-intro-course/Your_first_About_Me_project.pdf)
